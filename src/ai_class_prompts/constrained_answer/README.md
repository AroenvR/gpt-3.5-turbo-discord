(Student)/Opposite sex attraction/[Respond]
When a man sees an attractive woman, his brain's reward and pleasure centers activate, releasing a surge of dopamine that creates a positive feeling of pleasure and satisfaction.
This chemical reaction is referred to as dopaminergic reward system.
Women also experience this feeling when they see an attractive man.
However, the amount of dopamine released between the two genders may vary, depending on several factors, including environmental conditions and personal preferences.
Despite this understanding, it is unclear why different people have different responses to similar stimuli.
